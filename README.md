# RomCom  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
- Do you want to create your own romance book cover? Or are you an author and need quick ideas on what to write your book about? Well, our application is the one for you! 
- This application allows the user to create a randomly generated romance book cover. The user can also create they're own book cover by clicking on the `Make your own cover` button and filling out the form. Users can save their covers, and view all their favorite covers by clicking the `View Saved Covers` button. If they change their mind and don't like one of the covers they save, the user can double click on that book cover, and delete it.
### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
- Run this app by cloning the romcom directory to your local machine.  In the terminal change your directory to the romcom directory and use the command open index.html.  This will open the RomCom cover generator page on your broswer.
### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

- This is a completely custom screenshot that we made, with a unique cover, title, and taglines.
### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
- We spent a lot of time on this project, around 4 hours each day after class on the project.  We are on week 2 of Mod1 FE program at Turing.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
- This project really helped us better understand the DOM.  We acquired a deeper understanding of how querySelector, event listener, event handler, and event targeting work.  We were able to use the HTML and reference the CSS file to target specific classes, elements, and ids and then change their values with Javascript.
### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
Wins:
- We were able to display the users custom book cover by using `event.preventDefault`
- Figuring out how to correctly delete the saved book covers from its array and the DOM

Challenges:
- learning how to utilize `event.target()` in our code
- Knowing when we are in an unproductive struggle, and when to ask for help

We got over these challenges by taking POM's when we needed to, chekced in with other students who were having similar problems, and getting help from our classmates.
